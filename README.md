### ????? What is nodos?
**nodos**, is a secure & fast operating system that looks up for **user's security and privacy**. ?

### ?? About
- Our operating system is based on C# for most of it (Named Karrot).

- The name **nodos** comes up as a reference of the structuring for this OS.

- We work with ***a custom file system*** called ``PlutonFS``, made by [@Gabolate](https://github.com/Gabolate).

### Installation 
Download the latest [ISO file](https://github.com/xhyabunny/nodos/releases/tag/latest) from our release section to get it installed either on your USB with [Rufus 3.18](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.18/rufus-3.18.exe), or in a *virtual machine*.

? Once those steps are done and you have set up your USB/Virtual Machine to run the OS, you're good to go and use it wherever and whenever you want!
